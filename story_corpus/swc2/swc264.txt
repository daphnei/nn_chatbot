This place gave name to the family of Pendrea, or Pender.
Hals says, "John Pendrea, the last of his tribe, temps.
Henry VI, having only two daughters, that became his heirs, who were married to Bonython, of Carclew, and Noy.
To Noy's share fell this tenement of Pendrea, which was the dwelling of him and his posterity for several descents; and here was born, as I was informed, William Noy, the Attorney General to Charles I, who designed to have built a noteable house here, but was prevented by death, having before brought great quantities of materials to this place in order thereto.
His grandson, William Noy, Esq., sold this place, and several others, to my very kind friend Christopher Davies, gent., now in possession thereof.
Baranhual, at one time the residence of the Penders, came from them to the Noyes, and was sold by the Noyes to the Davises.
Here was to be seen, until recently, a small room encrusted with shells, which was said to be the work of some ladies of the Davies family.
The design of the work was Charles II shown flying from his enemies, and one of them, in full pursuit, had the legend, "This is the heir, come let us kill him, that .
the inheritance may be our own," whilst an angel calls from a cloud, "Is it not written thou shalt do no murder?"
The materials of this work are principally shells from Parcurnow.
In 1750 Davies sold Baranhual, and some other farms, to Admiral Boscawen, in whose family it still remains.
Pendrea, and much other property in Buryan, belong to the Rev.
John Tonkin, of Trevedern.
