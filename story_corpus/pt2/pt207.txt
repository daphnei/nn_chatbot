XXIII.
FOUR were watching cattle in Baileburgh (Burgh F Farm).
They were in a fold.
The four were Domhnull MacGhilleathain, Domhnull Mac-an-t-Saoir, Calum MacNill, and Domhnull Domhnullach.
They saw a dog.
Calum MacNill said that they should strike the dog.
Said Domhnull MacGhilleathain, "We will not strike.
If thou strikest him thou wilt repent it."
Calum MacNill struck the dog, and his hand and his arm lost their power.
He felt a great pain in his hand and his arm, and one of the other lads carried his stick home; he could not carry it himself.
He was lamenting his hand, and he went where there was an old woman, Nic a Phi, to get knowledge about his hand.
She said to him that he would be so till the end of a day and a year; and at the end of a day and year, to go to the knoll and say to it, "If thou dost not let with me the strength of my hand, I or my race will leave neither stick nor stone of thee that we will not drive to pieces."
At the end of a day and year his comrades said, "There is now a day and year since thou hast lost the power of thy hand, come to the knoll till thy hand get its power, as the woman said."
He went himself and his comrades.
They reached the hill.
He drew his stick, and he said to the knoll, "If thou dost not let with me the strength of my hand, I myself or my race will leave neither stick nor stone of thee that we will not drive to pieces."
And he got the power of his hand.
