Why the Robin's Breast is Red
A WELSH boy was throwing stones one day at a robin redbreast.
"My poor boy," said his grandmother to him, "have you not heard of the fiery pit and how this merciful bird takes cool dew on his little bill and lets it fall on sinful souls in torment?
The marks of the fire that scorches him as he drops the water are to be seen on his red breast.
Never throw a stone at a robin."
