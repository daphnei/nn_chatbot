FINLAND<BR>
OF<BR>
THE THOUSAND LAKES<BR>
LOST DAUGHTER OF THE<BR>
BALTIC SEA</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Where the lovely lilies tremble,<BR>
Golden lilies on the waters;<BR>
Where the fir tree points its candles,<BR>
Points its slender spire towards Heaven;<BR>
And the streams make mighty music,<BR>
From the rocks in cascades foaming--<BR>
There dwells Finland's Baltic Wizard,<BR>
There he makes his Tales of Wonder.<BR>
Welds them on his Forge of Magic,<BR>
Beats them with his Magic Hammer.</P>
<P>They are wrought from Songs of Magic,<BR>
Songs of ancient Vainamoinen,<BR>
Finland's vanished sweet-tongued Wizard,<BR>
Wrought from Runes of Vainamoinen;<BR>
Till they live and leap and quiver,<BR>
Till they shout with songs and laughter,<BR>
Till they weep with tears of woman,<BR>
Till they stir the heart with pity.<BR>
So makes Finland's Baltic Wizard<BR>
All his Tales of Magic Wonder;<BR>
Beats them on his Forge of Magic,<BR>
Beats them with his Magic Hammer.</P>
