ALLHALLOWS-EVE AT ST IVES.
THE ancient custom of providing children with a large apple on Allhallows-eve is still observed, to a great extent, at St Ives.
"Allan-day," as it is called, is the day of days to hundreds' of children, who would deem it a great misfortune were they to go to bed on "Allan-night" without the time-honoured Allan apple to hide beneath their pillows.
A quantity of large apples are thus disposed of the sale of which is dignified by the term Allan Market.
