<P>See! O see! the Amber Wizard,<BR>
Lithuania's Amber Wizard,<BR>
How he shakes his head all golden,<BR>
Puffs his cheeks as red as apples,<BR>
Steps into the foaming wavelets,<BR>
Dives into the Baltic billows;<BR>
Downward, downward to the forests,<BR>
Ancient pine trees 'neath the waters,<BR>
Pine trees shedding balsam amber,<BR>
Fragrant amber, light as feathers!</P>
<P>And the Amber Wizard loosens<BR>
Lumps of amber, beads of amber,<BR>
Casts them upwards through the waters,<BR>
Casts them on the sandy seashore;<BR>
For the little ones to gather,<BR>
As they run beside the wavelets.<BR>
Then they rub the balsam amber,<BR>
Yellow amber, nut-brown amber,<BR>
Amber like the drops of honey,<BR>
Crying, "See it glow with shining!"<BR>
Crying, "Feel it tingle gently!"<BR>
Crying, "Smell it, weird and spicy!"<BR>
And the Amber Wizard watches,<BR>
Shakes his head all bright and golden,<BR>
Puffs his checks as red as apples,<BR>
Smiles, and tosses high the amber!</P>
