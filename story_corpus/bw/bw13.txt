Baltic Wizards: Finland of the Thousand Lakes, Lost Daughter of the Baltic Sea: From Finland
Where the lovely lilies tremble, Golden lilies on the waters; Where the fir tree points its candles, Points its slender spire towards Heaven; And the streams make mighty music, From the rocks in cascades foaming-- There dwells Finland's Baltic Wizard, There he makes his Tales of Wonder.
Welds them on his Forge of Magic, Beats them with his Magic Hammer.They are wrought from Songs of Magic, Songs of ancient Vainamoinen, Finland's vanished sweet-tongued Wizard, Wrought from Runes of Vainamoinen; Till they live and leap and quiver, Till they shout with songs and laughter, Till they weep with tears of woman, Till they stir the heart with pity.
So makes Finland's Baltic Wizard All his Tales of Magic Wonder; Beats them on his Forge of Magic, Beats them with his Magic Hammer.
