Baltic Wizards: Latvia Of Feast Of Flowers, And, Courland, God's Own Little Country: From Latvia
Kurbads, merry Lettland's Wizard, With his Magic Incantations, Calls the gold and silver to him; Calls the jewels and the amber; Calls the casks all filled with riches; And they lie in heaps before him, There they shine and gleam and glitter.
Then he summons all his Witches, Old and wrinkled, toothless, grinning, Bids them bide away the Treasures In the ruins of the castles, Underneath the ancient stone-heaps, In the deep and dismal caverns.
Then he throws a Spell upon them, Binds the Treasures with his Magic, That no mortal eye may spy them, And no mortal Song unloose them.
Thus he hoards his glittering wonders, With his Magic Incantations, Kurbads, merry Lettland's Wizard!
