<P>SPLASH, SPLASH! SPLISH, SPLASH! SPLISH, SPLASH, SPLISH! Listen to the Wizard with the apple-red cheeks!</P>
<P>Once on a time, a poor man went into the woods to the riverbank. He chopped down a tree, chop! chop! As he chopped, crick! crack! the axehead fell from its handle, splash! into the deep water of the river.</P>
<P>The poor man cried out, "Oh-o-o-o-o! My axe! A-a-a-a-a-a-a! Who will fish it out for me? My poor little axe!"</P>
<P>Just then, limpity, limpity! limp! a very very old man came limping up, and asked:</P>
<P>"Why do you yell so loud? What has happened to you?"</P>
<P>"Oh-o-o-o-o! My axehead is gone. It has fallen into the water, and I have nothing to buy another with. I am so poor! How can I chop down trees now, and earn bread for my children?"</P>
<P>"Be quiet! Stop yelling! I will fish it out for you."</P>
<P>And then--rip! rip! rip! the old man tore off his coat, and sprang, splish, splash! into the water. After a while, hippity, hop! he stood up in the water, and held Out a golden axehead.</P>
<P>"There! Take it! Isn't that your axe?"</P>
<P>"O no! O no! It isn't mine," answered the poor man.</P>
<P>Again, splish, splash! the old man dived under the water. After a while, hippity, hop! he stood up with an axehead of silver.</P>
<P>"It isn't mine!" cried the poor man hardly looking at it at all.</P>
<P>The third time, splish, splash! into the water, and the old man brought up the iron axehead.</P>
<P>"That is my little axe! That is my little axe!" shrieked the poor man full of joy. "Thanks be to you, that I have it again!"</P>
<P>He grasped the axe, snitch, snatch! from the old man's hand. Then right about face! Forward march! He started for his home. But:-</P>
<P>"Hi, there!" cried the old man after him. "Because you are such an honest, contented man, here, I'll give you these golden and silver axeheads."</P>
<P>When the poor man reached home, chit! chat! chit! how he chattered about it all! And a neighbor heard him, a greedy man, a Never-Enough.</P>
<P>The Never-Enough thought a bit, ran! rin! ran into the woods, and Aha! chopped a tree, chip! chop! in the same place. His axehead, which he had loosened, fell splash! into the water.</P>
<P>Then he began to yell, "Oh-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!"</P>
<P>Limpity, limpity! limp! the old man stood there.</P>
<P>"What has happened to you?"</P>
<P>"My own little axehead, splash! has fallen into the water and sunk. Who will find it for me?"</P>
<P>"I will!" cried the old man, and sprang splish, splash! into the water.</P>
<P>After a while, hippity, hop! there he was again in the water, with the iron axehead.</P>
<P>"Here is your axe."</P>
<P>"That isn't mine! That isn't mine! answered the Never-Enough.</P>
<P>Again, splish, splash! the old man in the water, and hippity, hop! after a while back again with the silver axehead!</P>
<P>"Is that yours?"</P>
<P>"It's not mine! Mine was different."</P>
<P>The third time, splish, splash, splish! the old man in the water, and hippity, hop! out of the water again with the golden axehead!</P>
<P>"That is mine!" cried the greey Never-Enough, full of joy.</P>
<P>And because he lied so shamelessly, hi there! the old man dived into the water, and did not come back.</P>
<P>As for the golden axehead, zip! it passed close to the nose of the Never-Enough. He kept on waiting, waiting, for some one to bring him a diamond axehead!</P>
<P>And maybe he is waiting there still!</P>
