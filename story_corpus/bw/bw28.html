<P>Kurbads, merry Lettland's Wizard,<BR>
With his Magic Incantations,<BR>
Calls the gold and silver to him;<BR>
Calls the jewels and the amber;<BR>
Calls the casks all filled with riches;<BR>
And they lie in heaps before him,<BR>
There they shine and gleam and glitter.</P>
<P>Then he summons all his Witches,<BR>
Old and wrinkled, toothless, grinning,<BR>
Bids them bide away the Treasures<BR>
In the ruins of the castles,<BR>
Underneath the ancient stone-heaps,<BR>
In the deep and dismal caverns.</P>
<P>Then he throws a Spell upon them,<BR>
Binds the Treasures with his Magic,<BR>
That no mortal eye may spy them,<BR>
And no mortal Song unloose them.<BR>
Thus he hoards his glittering wonders,<BR>
With his Magic Incantations,<BR>
Kurbads, merry Lettland's Wizard!</P>
