The Parti-Coloured Cow
A PARTI-COLOURED cow once appeared on the high moor-lands of Denbighshire.
Everyone who was in want of milk went to her, and however big a vessel was taken, it was always filled with rich milk.
However often she was milked, it made no difference.
This continued for a long time, and glad indeed were the people to avail themselves of her unfailing supply.
At last a wicked witch determined to milk her dry.
The hag took a riddle and milked and milked the parti-coloured cow until at last the milk ran dry.
Immediately the cow went off to a lake near Cerrig y Drudion, bellowing horribly, and disappeared under its waters.
