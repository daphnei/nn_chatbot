A Fairy Dog
GOING home from Pentre Voelas Church, the good wife of Hafod y Gareg found a little dog in an exhausted state on the ground.
She took it up tenderly and carried it home in her apron.
This she did partly from natural kindliness of heart and partly from fear, because she remembered what had happened to her cousin of Bryn Heilyn.
She had come across a strange little dog and treated it cruelly.
The fairies had come to her as she was taking glasdwr (which is butter-milk diluted with water) to the hayfield.
They seized her and enquired whether she would travel above wind, mid wind or below wind.
She ought to have selected the middle course, which would have meant a pleasant voyage through the air at a moderate height, equally removed from the clouds and the earth.
Above wind is a giddy and terrible passage through the thin ether between the worlds, and it was well that she did not choose it.
But the course she made choice of, below wind, was almost as bad, because she was snatched through miry bog and swampy lea, through brambles and briars, until all her clothes were torn off her body, and she was brought back to her home scratched and bleeding all over.
The good wife of Hafod y Gareg had no desire for any such excursions, and she made a nice soft bed for the fairy dog in the pantry, and fed it well.
The following day a company of fairies came to the farmhouse to make enquiries about it.
She told them it was safe and sound, and that they were welcome to take it away.
In gratitude for her kindness, they asked her which she would prefer, a clean or a dirty cowyard.
Reflecting that you cannot have a clean cowyard unless your cows are very few in number, she gave the right answer, a dirty cowyard.
She found two cows for every one she had possessed before, and their milk made the best butter in the whole neighbourhood.
