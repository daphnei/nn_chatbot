<p align="center">A STORY ABOUT A DARNING-NEEDLE</p>  
<p>There was once a Darning-needle who thought herself so fine that she believed she was an embroidery-needle.&nbsp; 'Take great care to hold me tight!' said the Darning-needle to the Fingers who were holding her.&nbsp; 'Don't let me fall!&nbsp; If I once fall on the ground I shall never be found again, I am so fine!'</p>  
<p>'It is all right!' said the Fingers, seizing her round the waist.</p>  
<p>'Look, I am coming with my train!' said the Darning-needle as she drew a long thread after her; but there was no knot at the end of the thread.</p>  
<p>The Fingers were using the needle on the cook's shoe.&nbsp; The upper leather was unstitched and had to be sewn together.</p>  
<p>'This is common work!' said the Darning-needle.&nbsp; 'I shall never get through it.&nbsp; I am breaking!&nbsp; I am breaking!'&nbsp; And in fact she did break.&nbsp; 'Didn't I tell you so!' said the Darning-needle.&nbsp; 'I am too fine!'</p>  
<p>'Now she is good for nothing!' said the Fingers; but they had to hold her tight while the cook dropped some sealing-wax on the needle and stuck it in the front of her dress.</p>  
<p>'Now I am a breast-pin!' said the Darning-needle.&nbsp; 'I always knew I should be promoted.&nbsp; When one is something, one will become something!'&nbsp; And she laughed to herself; you can never see when a Darning-needle is laughing.&nbsp; Then she sat up as proudly as if she were in a State coach, and looked all round her.</p>  
<p>'May I be allowed to ask if you are gold?' she said to her neighbour, the Pin. &nbsp;'You have a very nice appearance, and a peculiar head; but it is too small!&nbsp; You must take pains to make it grow, for it is not everyone who has a head of sealing-wax.'&nbsp;&nbsp; And so saying the Darning-needle raised herself up so proudly that she fell out of the dress, right into the sink which the cook was rinsing out.</p>  
<p>'Now I am off on my travels!' said the Darning-needle.&nbsp; 'I do hope I sha'n't get lost!' She did indeed get lost.</p>  
<p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="green">p. 320</font></A></p>  
<p>'I am too fine for this world!' said she as she lay in the gutter; 'but I know who I am, and that is always a little satisfaction!'</p>  
<p>And the Darning-needle kept her proud bearing and did not lose her good-temper.</p>  
<p>All kinds of things swam over her&#8212;shavings, bits of straw, and scraps of old newspapers.</p>  
<p>'Just look how they sail along!' said the Darning-needle.&nbsp; 'They don't know what is underneath them!&nbsp; Here I am sticking fast!&nbsp; There goes a shaving thinking of nothing in the world but of itself, a mere chip!&nbsp; There goes a straw&#8212;well, how it does twist and twirl, to be sure!&nbsp; Don't think so much about yourself, or you will be knocked against a stone.&nbsp; There floats a bit of newspaper.&nbsp; What is written on it is long ago forgotten, and yet how proud it is!&nbsp; I am sitting patient and quiet.&nbsp; I know who I am, and that is enough for me!'</p>  
<p>One day something thick lay near her which glittered so brightly that the Darning-needle thought it must be a diamond.&nbsp; But it was a bit of bottle-glass, and because it sparkled the Darning-needle spoke to it, and gave herself out as a breast-pin.</p>  
<p>'No doubt you are a diamond?'</p>  
<p>'Yes, something of that kind!' And each believed that the other was something very costly; and they both said how very proud the world must be of them.</p>  
<p>'I have come from a lady's work-box,' said Darning-needle, 'and this lady was a cook; she had five fingers on each hand; anything so proud as these fingers I have never seen!&nbsp; And yet they were only there to take me out of the work-box and to put me back again!'</p>  
<p>'Were they of noble birth, then?' asked the bit of bottle-glass.</p>  
<p>'Of noble birth!' said the Darning-needle; 'no indeed, but proud!&nbsp; They were five brothers, all called ''Fingers.'' They held themselves proudly one against the other, although they were of different sizes.&nbsp; The outside one, the Thumb, was short and fat; he was outside the rank, and had only one bend in his back, and could only make one bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man that he was no longer any use as a soldier.&nbsp; Dip-into-everything, the second finger, dipped into sweet things as well as sour things, pointed to the sun and the moon, and guided the pen when they wrote.&nbsp; Longman, the third, looked at the others over his shoulder.&nbsp; Goldband, the fourth, had a gold sash round his waist; and little Playman did nothing at all, and was the more proud.&nbsp; There was too much ostentation, and so I came away.'</p>  
<p><a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="green">p. 321</font></A></p>  
<p>'And now we are sitting and shining here!' said the bit of bottle-glass.</p>  
<p>At that moment more water came into the gutter; it streamed over the edges and washed the bit of bottle-glass away.</p>  
<p>'Ah!&nbsp; now he has been promoted!' said the Darning-needle.&nbsp; 'I remain here; I am too fine.&nbsp; But that is my pride, which is a sign of respectability!' And she sat there very proudly, thinking lofty thoughts.</p>  
<p>'I really believe I must have been born a sunbeam, I am so fine!&nbsp; It seems to me as if the sunbeams were always looking under the water for me.&nbsp; Ah, I am so fine that my own mother cannot find me!&nbsp; If I had my old eye which broke off, I believe I could weep; but I can't&#8212;it is not fine to weep!'</p>  
<p>One day two street-urchins were playing and wading in the gutter, picking up old nails, pennies, and such things.&nbsp; It was rather dirty work, but it was a great delight to them.</p>  
<p>'Oh, oh!' cried out one, as he pricked himself with the Darning-needle; 'he is a fine fellow though!'</p>  
<p>'I am not a fellow; I am a young lady!' said the Darning-needle; but no one heard.&nbsp; The sealing-wax had gone, and she had become quite black; but black makes one look very slim, and so she thought she was even finer than before.</p>  
<p>'Here comes an egg-shell sailing along!' said the boys, and they stuck the Darning-needle into the egg-shell.</p>  
<p>'The walls white and I black&#8212;what a pretty contrast it makes!' said the Darning-needle.&nbsp; 'Now I can be seen to advantage!&nbsp; If only I am not sea-sick!&nbsp; I should give myself up for lost!'</p>  
<p>But she was not sea-sick, and did not give herself up.</p>  
<p>'It is a good thing to be steeled against sea-sickness; here one has indeed an advantage over man!&nbsp; Now my qualms are over.&nbsp; The finer one is the more one can beat.'</p>  
<p>'Crack!' said the egg-shell as a wagon-wheel went over it.</p>  
<p>'Oh!&nbsp; how it presses!' said the Darning-needle.&nbsp; 'I shall indeed be sea-sick now.&nbsp; I am breaking!' But she did not break, although the wagon-wheel went over her; she lay there at full length, and there she may lie.</p>
