<p align="center">HOW TO TELL A TRUE PRINCESS</p>  
<p>There was once upon a time a Prince who wanted to marry a Princess, but she must be a true Princess.&nbsp; So he travelled through the whole world to find one, but there was always something against each.&nbsp; There were plenty of Princesses, but he could not find out if they were true Princesses.&nbsp; In every case there was some little defect, which showed the genuine article was not yet found.&nbsp; So he came home again in very low spirits, for he had wanted very much to have a true Princess.&nbsp; One night there was a dreadful storm; it thundered and lightened and the rain streamed down in torrents.&nbsp; It was fearful!&nbsp; There was a knocking heard at the Palace gate, and the old King went to open it.</p>  
<p>There stood a Princess outside the gate; but oh, in what a sad plight she was from the rain and the storm!&nbsp; The water was running down from her hair and her dress into the points of her shoes and out at the heels again.&nbsp; And yet she said she was a true Princess!</p>  
<p>'Well, we shall soon find that!' thought the old Queen.&nbsp; But she said nothing, and went into the sleeping-room, took off all the bed-clothes, and laid a pea on the bottom of the bed.&nbsp; Then she put twenty mattresses on top of the pea, and twenty eider-down quilts on the top of the mattresses.&nbsp; And this was the bed in which the Princess was to sleep.</p>  
<p>The next morning she was asked how she had slept.</p>  
<p>'Oh, very badly!' said the Princess.&nbsp; 'I scarcely closed my eyes all night!&nbsp; I am sure I don't know what was in the bed.&nbsp; I laid on something so hard that my whole body is black and blue.&nbsp; It is dreadful!'</p>  
<p>Now they perceived that she was a true Princess, because she had felt the pea through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down quilts.</p>  
<p>No one but a true Princess could be so sensitive.</p>

<p>So the Prince married her, for now he knew that at last he had got hold of a true Princess.&nbsp; And the pea was put into the Royal Museum, where it is still to be seen if no one has stolen it.&nbsp; Now this is a true story.</p>
