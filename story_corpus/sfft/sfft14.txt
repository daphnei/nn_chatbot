 THE FOX TROUBLED WITH FLEAS.
The fox is much troubled by fleas, and this is the way in which he gets rid of them.
He hunts about till he finds a lock of wool, and then he takes it to the river, and holds it in his mouth, and so puts the end of his brush into the water, and down he goes slowly.
The fleas run away from the water, and at last they all run over the fox's nose into the wool, and then the fox dips his nose under and lets the wool go off with the stream.
