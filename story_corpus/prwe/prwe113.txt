THE SUICIDE'S GHOST.
ON the bleak road between Helston and Wendron Church-town, at its highest and wildest spot, three roads meet about a quarter of a mile from the latter place.
Here, at "Three Cross," as the place is called, years ago, when the Downs being unenclosed, it was more desolate than it is even now, a poor suicide, named "Tucker," was buried.
Few liked to pass up Row's Lane, leading there, after nightfall; for Tucker's shade had more than once been seen.
One man, however, valiant in his cups, on his return from Helston market, cracked his whip, and shouted lustily, "Arise, Tucker!"
as he passed the place.
It is said Tucker did arise, and fixed himself on the saddle behind the man as he rode on horseback, and accompanied him--how far it is not said.
This was often repeated, until the spirit, becoming angry, refused any more to quit his disturber, and continued to trouble him, till "Parson Jago" was called in to use his skill, which was found effectual, in "laying" Tucker's spirit to rest.
