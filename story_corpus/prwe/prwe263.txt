LIGHTS SEEN BY THE CONVERTED.
  THERE is, in many parts of the county, a belief, derived no doubt from the recollection of St Paul's conversion, that, when sinners are converted, they see shining lights about themselves.
I have many times heard this, but every one seems to have his own particular mode of describing the phenomenon,--where they can be prevailed on to describe it at all,--and usually that is derived from some picture which has made an impression on their minds such as, "exactly like the light shining round the angel appearing to St Peter, in fayther's Bible."
