HOW TO EAT PILCHARDS.
IT is unlucky to commence eating pilchards, or, indeed, any kind I of fish, from the head downwards.
I have often heard persons rebuked for committing such a grievous sin, which is "sure to turn the heads of the fish away from the coasts."
The legitimate process--mark this, all fish-eaters--is  to eat the fish from the tail towards the head.
This brings the fish to our shores, and secures good luck to the fishermen.
