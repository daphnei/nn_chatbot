TREADING ON GRAVES
  "To see a man tread over graves, I hold it no good mark; 'Tis wicked in the sun and moon, And bad luck in the dark!
"So sings Coleridge in his ballad of "The Three Graves.
"Whenever a person shivers from a sensation of cold down the spine, it is said some one is walking over his or her grave.Persons believing this, will give directions that they may be buried in some secluded corner of the churchyard, so that their corpse may not be disturbed by unholy footsteps.
