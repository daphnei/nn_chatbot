ITCHING EARS
  WHEN the ears are red and itch, it is a sign that some one is talking of the suffering individual.
If it is the left ear, they are being scandalised; if the right ear, they are being praised.
Often have I heard, when the lower and middle class people have been indulging in some gossip of their neighbours or friends, "I 'II bet how their ears do itch."
