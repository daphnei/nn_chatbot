CHURCHES BUILT IN PERFORMANCE OF VOWS.
Amongst these may be named Brent Tor, thus spoken of by Mr Bray :--  "The church of Brent Tor is dedicated to St Michael.
And there is a tradition among the vulgar that its foundation was originally laid at the foot of the hill ; but that the enemy of all angels, the Prince of Darkness, removed the stones by night from the base to the summit,--probably to he nearer his own dominion, the air,--but that, immediately on the church's being dedicated to St Michael, the patron of the edifice hurled upon the devil such an enormous mass of rock that he never afterwards ventured to approach it.
Others tell us that it was erected by a wealthy merchant, who vowed, in the midst of a tremendous storm at sea (possibly addressing him.
self to his patron, St Michael, that if he escaped, he would built a church on the first land he descried."
Brent Tor is a very remarkable hill, and can be seen far off at sea.
This may possibly lend some support to the latter tradition.
St Anthony, in Kerrier, is likewise stated to be the consequence of a vow.
Soon after the Conquest, as some persons of rank and fortune were coming to England from Normandy, they were overtaken by a violent storm, from which they expected immediate destruction.
In the midst of their distress, they directed their prayers to St Anthony, and laid themselves under a solemn vow to erect a church to his memory, if he would save them from shipwreck; and that this church should be erected on the very spot where they should first get on shore.
Driven by the tempest, they were conducted, by a power fully equal to that which St Anthony might be supposed to possess, into St Mawe's harbour, and happily landed on that very spot where the church now stands.
And it appears that the materials with which the tower is built, and the situation which the church and tower occupy, are calculated to give sanction to this tradition.
