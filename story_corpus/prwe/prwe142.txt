THEODORE, KING OF CORNWALL
  RIVIERE, near Hayle, now called Rovier, was the palace of Theodore, the king, to whom Cornwall appears to have been indebted for many of its saints.
This Christian king, when the pagan people sought to destroy the first missionaries, gave the saints shelter in his palace, St Breca, St Iva, St Burianna, and many others, are said to have made Riviere their residence.
It is not a little curious to find traditions existing, as it were, in a state of suspension between opinions.
I have heard it said that there was a church at Rovier--that there was once a great palace there; and again, that Castle Cayle was one vast fortified place, and Rovier another.
Mr Davies Gilbert quotes Whitaker on this point -"Mr Whitaker, who captivates every reader by the brilliancy of his style, and astonishes by the extent of his multifarious reading, draws, however, without reserve, on his fertile imagination, for whatever facts may be requisite to construct the fabfic of a theory.
He has made Riviere the palace and residence of Theodore, a sovereign prince of Cornwall, and conducts St Breca, St Ira, with several companions, not only into Hayle and to this palace, after their voyage from Ireland, but fixes the time of their arrival so exactly, as to make it take place in the night.
In recent times thi name of Riviere, which had been lost in the common pronunciation, Rovier, has revived in a very excellent house built by Mr Edwards on the farm, which he completed in 1791."
