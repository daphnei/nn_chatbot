THE LAST WOLF IN ENGLAND
 THE extirpation of the wolves, which once existed in every part of these
islands, is an oft-told story.
  But it is not generally known that the last native wolf lived in the forests of Ludgvan, near Penzance.
The last of his race was a gigantic specimen, and terrible was the havoc made by him on the flocks.
Tradition tells us that at last he carried off a child.
This could not be endured, so the peasantry all turned out, and this famous wolf was captured at Rospeith, the name of a farm still existing in Ludgvan.
