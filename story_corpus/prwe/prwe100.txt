JAGO'S DEMON.
THE vicar of Wendron, who bore the name of Jago, appears to have had strange intercourse with the invisible world; or, rather, the primitive people of this district believe him to have possessed supernatural powers.
Any one visiting the parish of Wendron will be struck with many distinguishing features in its inhabitants.
It would appear as if a strange people had settled down amidst the races already inhabiting the spot, and that they had studiously avoided any intimate connection with their neighbours.
The dialect of the Wendron people is unlike any other in Cornwall, and there are many customs existing amongst them which are not found in any other part of the county.
Until of late years, the inhabitants of Wendron were quite uneducated;--.
hence the readiness with which they associate ancient superstitions with comparatively modern individuals.
The Reverend Mr Jago was no doubt a man who impressed this people with the powers of his knowledge.
Hence we are told that no spirit walking the earth could resist the spells laid upon him by Jago.
By his prayers--or powers--many a night wanderer has been put back into his grave, and so confined that the poor ghost could never again get loose.
To the evil-disposed Mr Jago was a terror.
All Wendron believed that every act was visible to the parson at the moment it was done-- day or night it mattered not.
He has been known to pick a thief at once out of a crowd, and criminal men or women could not endure the glance of his eye.
Many a person has at once confessed to guilty deeds of which they have been suspected the moment they have been brought before Mr Jago.
We are told that he had spirits continually waiting upon him, though invisible until he desired them to appear.
The parson rode far and wide over the moorland of his parish.
He never took a groom with him; for, the moment he alighted from his horse, he had only to strike the earth with his whip, and up came a demon-groom to take charge of the steed.
