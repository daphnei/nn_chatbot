THE DEVIL AND HIS DANDY-DOGS.
 A POOR herdsman was journeying homeward across the moors one windy night, when he heard at a distance among the Tors the baying of hounds, which he soon recognised as the dismal chorus of the dandy-dogs.
It was three or four miles to his house; and very much alarmed, he hurried onward as fast as the treacherous nature of the soil and the uncertainty of the path would allow; but, alas!
the melancholy yelping of the hounds, and the dismal bolloa of the hunter came nearer and nearer.
After a considerable run, they had so gained upon him, that on looking back,--oh horror!
he could distinctly see hunter and dogs.
The former was terrible to look at, and had the usual complement of saucer-eyes, horns, and tail, accorded by common consent to the legendary devil.
He was hiack, of course, and carried in his hand a long hunting-pole.
The dogs, a numerous pack, blackened the small patch of moor that was visible; each snorting fire, and uttering a yelp of indescribably frightful tone.
No cottage, rock, or tree was near to give the herdsman shelter, and nothing apparently remained to him but to abandon himself to their fury, when a happy thought suddenly flashed upon him and suggested a resource.
Just as they were about to rush upon him, he fell on his knees in prayer.
There was strange power in the holy words he uttered; for immediately, as if resistance had been offered, the hell-hounds stood at bay, howling more dismally than ever, and the hunter shouted, 'Bo Shrove,' which (says my informant means in the old language, 'The boy trays,' at which they all drew off on some other pursuit and disappeared."
