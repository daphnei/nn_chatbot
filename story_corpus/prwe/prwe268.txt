THE MUTTON FEAST.
  AN old tradition--the particulars of which I have failed to recover--says that a flock of sheep were blown from the Gwithian Sands over into St Ives Bay, and that the St Ives fishermen caught them,-- believing them to be a new variety of fish,--either in their nets, or with hook and line, and brought them ashore as their night's catch.
I learn that Mr Fortescue Hitchins, some fifty or sixty years since, wrote a "copy of verses" on this tradition, but I have never seen this production.
