PENGERSWICK
ANOTHER legend relates that it was not the stepmother found by Pengerswick whose "skin was covered with scales like a serpent," but that the lady brought 'home from Palestine by him was an Ophidian--a serpent-worshipper.
Hence she became celebrated as a woman possessed by a serpent--having a serpent's power--in fact, a Lamia.
This is the only tradition of the kind with which I am acquainted in this county.
