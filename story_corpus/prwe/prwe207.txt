THE VOICE FROM THE SEA.
A FISHERMAN or a pilot was walking one night on the sands at Porth-Towan, when all was still save the monotonous fall of the light waves upon the sand.
He distinctly heard a voice from the sea exclaiming,--  "The hour is come, but not the man."
 This was repeated three times, when a black figure, like that of a man, appeared on the top of the hill.
It paused for a moment, then rushed impetuously down the steep incline, over the sands, and was lost in the sea.
In different forms this story is told all around the Cornish coast.
