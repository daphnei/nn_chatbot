THE BONFIRE TEST
  A BONFIRE is formed of faggots of furze, ferns, and the like.
Men and maidens by locking hands form a circle, and commence a dance to some wild native song.
At length, as the dancers become excited, they pull each other from side to side across the fire.
If they succeed in treading out the fire without breaking the chain, none of the party will die during the year.
If, however, the ring is broken before the fire is extinguished, "bad luck to the weak hands," as my informant said.
