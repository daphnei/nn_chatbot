THE MERMAID'S VENGEANCE
"INEVITABLE death awaits the wretch who is seduced by their charms.
They seize and drown the swimmer, and entice the child; aitd when they anticipate that their malevolence will be gratified, they are seen gaily darting over the surface of the waters."
Since lhis tale has been in type, my attention has been called to an article on, the "Popular Mythology of the Middle Ages," by Sir F. Palgrave, in the Quarterly Review, No.
44, 1820.
The Nixies, to whom the above quotation especially refers, are in most respects like the Cornish mermaids.
