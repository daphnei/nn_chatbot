GOLDSITHNEY FAIR AND THE GLOVE
ON the 5th of August, St James's day (old style), a fair is held here, which was originally held in the Church-town of Sithney near Helston.In olden time, the good St Perran the Little gave to the wrestlers in his parish a glove as the prize, and the winner of the glove was permitted to collect the market toll on the day of the feast, and to appropriate the money to his own use.
The winner of the glove lived in the Church-town of Sithney, and for long long years the right of holding the fair remained undisputed.At length the miners of Goldsithney resolved to contest the prize, and they won it, since which time the fair has been held in that village, they paying to the poor of the parish of Sithney one shilling as compensation.Gilbert remarks "The displaying of a glove at fairs is an ancient and widely-extended custom.
Mr Lysons says it is continued at Chester.
The editor has seen a large ornamented glove over the guildhall at Exeter during the fairs."
