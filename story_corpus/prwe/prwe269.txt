THE FLOATING GRINDSTONE.
  I HAVE already told of St Piran and his grindstone.
I have, however, another and a more modern story, which is told with great glee at some of the social meetings of the fishermen.
This is given merely to indicate the simplicity of this honest race.A party was got together on a promontory at the extremity of the bay which enclosed a fishing-town.
They were gathered to see a wonder, a floating grindstone.
Seeing that grindstones were grindstones in those days, and worth many pounds sterling, a boat was manned, and away they went, the mover of the expedition being in the bow of the boat.As they approached the grindstone, this man planted his foot on the gunwale, ready for a spring.
They were close aboard the circular mass,--" All my own, and none for nobody," he cries, and sprang off, as he fancied, on to the grindstone.
Lo!
to his great surprise, he sank under water, presently popping up again within his charmed circle, to be greeted with roars of laughter.
He had leaped into a sheet of "salt sea foam" which had gathered, and was confined within a large hoop.
