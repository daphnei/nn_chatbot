ST CHIWIDDEN.
THE last Thursday--a clear week before Christmas day --was formerly always claimed by the tinners as a holiday, and was called by them White-Thursday (Jew-whidn), because on this day, according to tradition, black tin (tin ore) was first melted and refined into white tin.
From Jew-whian to Chi-widden 'is an easy transition.
Jew-whidn is a name given to the old furnaces generally called Jews'-houses.
