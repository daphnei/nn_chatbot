AMBROSIAE PETRAE
IN connection with the Bambury stone in Worcestershire, Mr. Jabez Allies remarks, and Dr. Nash is of the same opinion, that it was in all probability originally Ambury.

Let the reader remember the monkish traditions of Ambrosius, the exact likeness of these pillars on this coin to the stones at Stonehenge, the Ambrosiae Petrae; and if he does not think the origin of Ambrosbury, or Amesbury, was derived from the Ambrosiae Petrae, or anointed rocks of the Tyrian colonists, he will think the coincidence most remarkable."
"Main Ambrosiae petrae ambrosiae, signify the stones anointed with holy oil, consecrated; or, in a general sense, a temple, altar, or place of worship."
