THE SPANIARD AT PENRYN
IN the reign of James I. there happened to be upon our coast a Spanish vessel of war.
Favoured by the mists of evening and the growing darkness, the ship entered Falmouth Harbour unseen.
The crew armed themselves, and taking to their boats, proceeded with great caution to the town of Penryn, situated at the head of the harbour.
There they landed, formed themselves into proper order, and marched into the town, purposing to plunder the inhabitants and bum the town.
With steady tramp they cautiously proceeded up the dark main street, resolving to attack the principal dwellings first.
Suddenly a great shout was heard, drums and trumpets sounded, the noise of many feet rushing to and fro fell on the ears of the Spaniards.
Believing that they were discovered, and that preparations had been made for their reception, fear seized them, and they fled precipitately to their boats and left the town.
The martial music proceeded, however, from a temporary theatre, in which a troop of strolling players were entertaining the people.
