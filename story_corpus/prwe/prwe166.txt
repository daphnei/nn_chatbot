DAMELIOCK CASTLE
THIS ancient British castle once stood in savage grandeur a rival to Tintagel.
Its ruins, which can scarcely be traced, are in the parish of St Tudy.
Here Gothlois of the Purple Spear, Earl of Cornwall, fortified himself against Uter Pendragon's soldiery, and here he was slain.
Gothlois, or Gothlouis, was the husband of Igerna, who was so cruelly deceived by Uter, and who became the mother of Arthur.
